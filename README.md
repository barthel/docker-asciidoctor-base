# Asciidoctor Base/Original &mdash; multi platform Edition

The goal of this project is to build a multi platform (especially armv7) Docker image based on the original [Asciidoctor Docker image](https://github.com/asciidoctor/docker-asciidoctor).

## ⚠️ Note

As long as [`erd`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/erd) is only available for `x86-64`, it will be removed from the original Asciidoctor Docker image before multi platform build.

Unfortunately `erd` could not be used in this created multi platform Docker images.

If you need `erd`, please use the original [Asciidoctor Docker image](https://github.com/asciidoctor/docker-asciidoctor) instead.
