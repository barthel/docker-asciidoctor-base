# Asciidoctor Base/Original &mdash; multi platform Edition

The goal of this project is to build a multi platform (especially armv7) Docker image based on the original [Asciidoctor Docker image](https://github.com/asciidoctor/docker-asciidoctor).

## ⚠️ Note

As long as Java is only as OpenJDK 8 available in Alpine Linux (`armv7` branch), the original OpenJDK will be replaced with OpenJDK 8.

If you need the original OpenJDK version, please use the original [Asciidoctor Docker image](https://github.com/asciidoctor/docker-asciidoctor) instead.
